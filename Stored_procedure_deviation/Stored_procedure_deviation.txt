Stored Procedure: proc_deviation

Description:

The "proc_deviation" stored procedure is designed to perform a series of operations related to data extraction and file generation. The primary purpose of this procedure is to extract data from an external source, process it, and export it to a CSV file for archiving and reporting purposes. The procedure is executed with elevated privileges, ensuring access to the necessary resources.

Procedure Steps:

Temporary Table Creation: The procedure begins by checking for the existence of a temporary table named "#xs." If the table exists, it is dropped to ensure a clean slate. Subsequently, data is extracted from an external source using the OPENQUERY function and loaded into the "#xs" table. The data includes information related to various attributes.

Intermediate Table Creation: Similarly, the procedure checks for the existence of another temporary table named "##x" and drops it if it exists. The data from the "#xs" table is then joined with data from other tables. The resulting dataset is loaded into the "##x" table and includes information such as various attributes. Data filtering and sorting are applied to refine the dataset.

File Export: The procedure dynamically constructs an SQL Server query and exports the data from the "##x" table to a CSV file using the sqlcmd utility. The resulting CSV file is saved with a filename containing the current date.

Error Handling: The procedure includes a comprehensive error-handling mechanism. In the event of an error, it captures error details and sends an email notification to designated recipients with detailed error information.

Technologies and Tools:

SQL Server: The stored procedure is designed to be executed within a SQL Server environment.
SQLCMD: The sqlcmd utility is used to execute SQL queries and export data to a CSV file.
T-SQL: The Transact-SQL language is used for writing and executing SQL queries within the stored procedure.
SQL Server Agent: The procedure is likely scheduled to run periodically using SQL Server Agent.
Results and Purpose:

The "proc_deviation" stored procedure serves the purpose of automating data extraction, processing, and archiving tasks. It plays a crucial role in generating historical data reports. The CSV files produced by the procedure are stored for future reference and analysis.

Skills and Expertise Gained:

Participating in the development and maintenance of the "proc_deviation" stored procedure has provided me with valuable skills in Transact-SQL, data extraction, temporary table management, and error handling in SQL Server environments. Additionally, I gained experience in automating file export processes and interfacing with external systems for data retrieval.

This stored procedure exemplifies my ability to design and implement data processing routines and to handle error scenarios effectively within a database management context.
