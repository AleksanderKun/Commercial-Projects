Project: Trading Data Analysis
Project Description:
The trading data analysis project aims to prepare data and create a report in PowerBI for studying trading results for individual logins. The primary data source is the "close trades" table in the database. This project leverages skills in PowerBI, T-SQL, PostgreSQL, and Python.

Required Fields in the Report:

Number of trades per instrument.
Total instrument result.
Median result per position per instrument.
Average result per position per instrument.
Standard deviation of the result per position per instrument.
Median duration per position per instrument.
Average duration per position per instrument.
Maximum duration per position per instrument.
Minimum duration per position per instrument.
Standard deviation of duration per position per instrument.
Profit on trades.
Number of trades.
Percentage of profitable trades.
Percentage of profitable trades in time intervals: up to 2 minutes, 2-10 minutes, 10-30 minutes, 30-120 minutes, 2-10 hours, 10-24 hours, 1-5 days, 5-30 days, more than 30 days.
Data Analysis:

Detailed results per instrument: spread, closed, delta, comm, swap, roll, MM.
NBC value, corr, deposits, withdrawals.
Trade turnover statistics per instrument asset class, nominal, lot.
Distribution of trade results.
Chart of results (closed+open) at the end of the day.
Information about all accounts and individuals.
Position vs. portfolio statistics (xrisk data) per symbol.
ML entry statistics (considering effective margin and Trading_ratio).
Execution times, average profitable time, average losing time, number of losing and profitable trades, losing/profitable ratios.
Origin of data.
Hedge simulation as the final point (for consideration).
Project Benefits:
This project will enhance the understanding and analysis of trading results, facilitating more informed investment decisions. Utilizing PowerBI and T-SQL/PostgreSQL databases allows for efficient data analysis.

Conclusions and Skills Gained:
This project has allowed me to develop skills in data analysis using PowerBI and working with T-SQL and PostgreSQL databases. I gained experience in creating advanced trading data reports and visualizations, which can significantly contribute to making informed decisions in the future.
